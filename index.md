## Welcome to Enjoy Curse of Knowledge

This is a page for setting up a few down-to-earth goals that I will do in near future with priorities. I will tick marks to projects that's done or I think could be skipped (since there's too many to be done if I'm not selective)

## 61c Projects

Having a deeper understanding of CNN and deep learning will make me doing the two projects left much more smoothly, but still by completing these without those knowledge is necessary since OS should have higher priority than deep learning.
