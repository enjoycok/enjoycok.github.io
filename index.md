## Welcome to Enjoy Curse of Knowledge

Page for setting up a few down-to-earth goals that I will do in near future with priorities. Will give ticks to any projs that's done and any projs I think could be skipped (since there's too many to be done if I'm not selective)

# 61c Projects

Proj 3 and proj 4 are projects that haven't completed. My opinion is having a deeper understanding of CNN and deep learning will make me doing these two much more comfortably, but still by completing these without those knowledge is necessary since it could give me a better understanding of parallel programming, which could enhance the understanding in OS. And OS has higher priority in my goals.

# OS

OS projs are not started. My goal is to go through all of them. I will only skip projs if I think the knowledge it provides is more advanced than basic or necessary.
